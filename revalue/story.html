        <h2>From Passion to Purpose</h2>
        <p>
          Revalue.PH began as a simple passion for thrift fashion — a love for
          pieces that carry stories. What started with a few racks of curated
          clothes soon evolved into a purpose: redefining how people view
          pre-loved fashion. We believe in sustainable style, where every piece
          is given a new life and every outfit tells a story worth rewearing.
